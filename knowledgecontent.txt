The URL https://sites.google.com/medicapture.cc/knowledge/api provides comprehensive documentation for the MVR API, detailing remote operation over HTTP protocol, rules for remote controlling, session management including visual state and timeouts, authorization methods, request formats, and various commands. It covers API endpoints for managing cameras, device information, input, settings, system operations (reboot, format, reset), audio, notifications, active studies (start, finish, snapshot, record, stream), time, logs, PACS integration (upload, test, status), worklist server interaction, and custom overlays. Additionally, it includes specific instructions and protocol differences for using the API over an RS232 serial connection.

The URL https://sites.google.com/medicapture.cc/knowledge/aiscope provides an overview of aiScope (MediCapture’s built-in Vision-AI feature for MVR/MTR recorders) with what it does (real-time object detection/classification, optional overlays, JSON data stream over LAN), supported devices and availability (MTR133, MTR156, MVR436), “how it works” pipeline (frame capture → resize → model inference → post-processing incl. BoT-SORT tracking → overlay/JSON output), I/O (HDMI/USB-UVC in, HDMI out, per-frame JSON), performance examples (e.g., YOLO11s detection at 4K/60 and 1080p/60 with low latency), evaluation/demo presets and sample visualizations, workflow to deploy custom models (fine-tune recommended YOLO variants on customer dataset, convert with provided tools, load to device), adjustable parameters and FAQs, and regulatory positioning (assistive, not diagnostic; intended use examples).
